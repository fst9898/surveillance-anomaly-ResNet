# surveillance-anomaly-ResNet-PINN
This project focuses on anomaly detection and monitoring in surveillance videos. Manual video analysis is time-consuming and traditional methods often fail to achieve high accuracy. To address this, we implement a ResNet-18 deep neural network for feature extraction and classification.

Key contributions:

Construction of a synthetic dataset with 5 video classes (Normal, Brightness Over, Noise, Color Distortion, Video Jamming).

Implementation and training of ResNet-18 with He initialization and SGD optimizer.
